*globjects* is an [MIT licensed](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT), cross-platform C++ wrapper for [OpenGL API](http://www.opengl.org) objects.

*globjects* provides object-oriented interfaces to the OpenGL API (3.0 and higher).
It reduces the amount of OpenGL code required for rendering and facilitates coherent OpenGL use by means of an additional abstraction layer to [glbinding](https://github.com/cginternals/glbinding) and [GLM](https://github.com/g-truc/glm). Common rendering tasks and processes are automated and missing features of specific OpenGL drivers are partially simulated or even emulated at run-time.
